# Missing-semester-2020-MIT

## Hi üëã

This is my personal learning record for Missing-semester-2020 of MIT. 



It's amazing ! I didn't realize how powerful some tools may be until I finishied this course. I LEARNED A LOT. Now I fell comfortable when I use the terminal, vim, unix-comand etc. 



At first, we choose the tool we like. However, it will shape us in the future. I would say it's necessary to deep dive into the tools and get familiar with them. That's what the course do :)
